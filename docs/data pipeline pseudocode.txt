## Classifier
# Shuffle features
# Split into training and test set
# Standardize features (by training set's std dev and mean)

# Train classifier (SVM?) using training data
# Get classifier's probabilities and predictions for the test set
# Use probabilities to get ROC curves
# Use predictions to get confusion matrix, precision, recall, accuracy, etc.
